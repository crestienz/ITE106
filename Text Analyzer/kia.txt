As the late afternoon draped the world in a soft, golden glow, the sun whispered its warmth, casting gentle shadows that stretched lazily across the ground. The air began to cool, wrapping the scene in a tender embrace. The place was too noisy for my liking, yet I sat on the bench, watching the ball game. It was an impulsive idea to sneak out and watch the game instead of locking myself in my room to study. The field was crowded with familiar faces. Some greeted me and teased me for being there. While I was too busy looking around, there he was, tall and broad, waving at me. He started running when he saw me on the bench, smiling and calling my name as if I were a mile away. 

His eyes met mine, and in their depths, I found a reflection of endless affection. The wind swirled around us like an invisible dance, and in that moment, he pulled me into the warmth of his arms. His embrace was both a shelter and a promise as he held me tight, pressing a kiss to the top of my head.
